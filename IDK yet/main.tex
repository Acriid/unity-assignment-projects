\section{Design}
The game being designed will be a puzzle horror game in which the player
needs to escape from a room. Each time the player escapes something new is
added to the map or mechanics. The player's goal will be to escape every
time, but there will be rooms/items/areas which will try to entice the 
player through their curiosity in order to keep the player from escaping.

\subsection{Goals}

\subsubsection{Player Curiosity}
The game will try to entice the player to do other actions that are
disadvantageous for the player. Some of these actions are asking the player
if they are sure when using an item or highlighting doors that lead to 
enemies. To keep the player playing the game after they beat it the player
must be kept curios about the stuff they missed or the extra elements added
after they beat it.

\subsubsection{Game over system}
Each time the player beats the game they will have to play it over again, but this time
something new is added. The Game over system will keep track of how many times the player
compleates the game and which mechanics / map objects will be added. This system allows
the player to experience different endings to the game.

\subsubsection{Enemy Ai}
